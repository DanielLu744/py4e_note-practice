A program is made up of one or more objects working together
Objects make use of each other's capabilities

Object:
    An object is a bit of self-contained Code and Data
    To break the problem into small and understandable parts
    Has boundaries that allow us to ignore un-needed detail
    I.e. String Objects, ist Objects, Dictionary Objects, etc.

Class:
    A template that can be used to construct an object 
    Defines the attributes and methods that will make up the object
    I.e. Dog

Method or Message:
    A defined capability of a class
    A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class
    I.e. bark()

Field or Attribute:
    A bit of data in a class
    A variable that is part of a class
    I.e. length

Object or Instance:
    A particular instance of a class
    Contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class
    I.e. Lassie

Constructor:
    An optional specially named method (__init__) that is called at the moment when a class is being used to construct an object
    Usually this is used to set up initial values for the object

Destructor:
    An optional specially named method (__del__) that is called at the moment just before an object is destroyed
    Destructors are rarely used

Inheritance"
    The ability to extend a class to make a new class
    When we create a new class (child) by extending an existing class (parent)
    The child class has all the attributes and methods of the parent class plus additional attributes and methods defined by the child class.
